# PyQT experiment
Repo contains one semester of tasks. 

## What it can do
- Basic arithmetics in various numeric systems;
- Calculate basic combinatoric formulas;
- Create and manipulate an array. First one is reimplementation of the original python list, another one is singly linked list;
- Create and manipulate a tree;
- Create an array and sort it. Recreation of the qsort algorithm.

## Logic
To see the implementations of the above features see `modules/` folder.

## UI
UI is generated with a help of QTDesigner Tool. UI is in `qtdesigns/` folder. Transformation to the python class is made via `pyuic5` and the output is located in `pages/` folder. 

## WIP
- Refactoring of the arithmetics; 
- A tree built on top off linked lists;
- TBA...
